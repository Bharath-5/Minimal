* Usage

** Default modifier key is [Super]. [S] below represents [Super] key
** Most of the programs are mapped to [Super] + Function keys. The applications open up in their own workspaces as follows:

| Workspace Number | Description           | Keybindings                                                    |
|------------------+-----------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------|
|                1 | Browser/WWW           | [S] + F1 = Qutebrowser                                         |
|                2 | File Manager          | [S] + F2 = PCManFM                                             |
|                3 | Terminal/Code         | [S] + [Shift] + [Enter] = URxvt                                |
|                4 | Office Programs/Notes | [S] + F4 = LibreOffice [OTile]                                 |
|                5 | General/VM            | [S] + p = dmenu                                                |
|                6 | Email/Vid             | [S] + F6 = Thunderbird [Qile]; mpv opens here [DWM]            |
|                7 | Social                | [S] + F7 = Telegram-desktop [QTile]                            |
|                8 | Other/Dw              | [S] + F3 = Lynx browser [QTile]; Transmission opens here [DWM] |

** Most other keybindings are as close to their defaults. Emacs uses evil keybindings
